# GIPHY API Assignment

For this assignment, you will be using the GIPHY API to create a simple, fun app.

## Getting Started

### Create a GIPHY Developer Account

You will be creating an account on the [GIPHY Developer page](https://developers.giphy.com/) to get an API key.

### Obtain Your API Key

Once you create an account, you will create an API key that can be used for your app. An API key is just a way of authenticating who you are and allowing you to use it.

"An API key acts as a unique identifier used to verify the identity of an application or user attempting to access an API, allowing the API provider to control who can access its resources and monitor usage."

**Note:** This API key will be used as part of the URL.

### Working Version

Check out a working version (https://stackblitz-starters-9w9cti.stackblitz.io/) to get a better idea of how it works.

## Application Behavior

- When the app is initially loaded, it will request a GIPHY image with a default keyword (I used 'cat', but you can use anything you want).
- The user can type in a keyword and when the submit button is pressed, a new GIPHY image replaces it.

That's it. ðŸ˜Š
